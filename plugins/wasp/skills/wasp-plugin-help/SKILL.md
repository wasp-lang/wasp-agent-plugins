# 🐝 Wasp Plugin for Claude Code

## What This Plugin Does

This plugin makes Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, etc. work better with Wasp by:

1. **Using the right documentation** — Automatically fetches the correct Wasp docs for your project's version
2. **Avoiding common mistakes** — Provides Wasp-specific tips, patterns, and best practices so the agent doesn't hallucinate or use outdated approaches
3. **Guided workflows** — Skills and commands so the agent can walk you through setting up Wasp's batteries-included features (auth, email, database, styling) and deploying
4. **Full debugging visibility** — Start managed databases, dev servers, and connect browser console access so the agent has full development and debugging visibility across the entire stack

The result: The agent actually understands Wasp instead of guessing.


## Quick Reference

Skills:
`add-feature` - Add Wasp's built-in features (auth, email, database, styling)
`deploying-app` - Guided deployment to Railway or Fly.io
`expert-advice` - Get advice on app improvements and functionality from a Wasp expert
`start-dev-server` - Start dev environment with full debugging visibility (db -> server -> browser console)
`wasp-plugin-init` - Adds Wasp knowledge, LLM-friendly documentation fetching instructions, and best practices to your project's CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md file
