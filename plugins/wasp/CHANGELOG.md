# Changelog

All notable changes to the Wasp Claude Code plugin will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- Multi-agent support: skills now work with Codex, Gemini, Copilot, OpenCode, and other agents via AGENTS.md
- Installation path for non-Claude agents via `npx skills add wasp-lang/claude-plugins`
- `wasp-plugin-init` skill now asks whether the user is on Claude Code (CLAUDE.md) or another agent (AGENTS.md) and follows the appropriate flow
- Chrome DevTools MCP install instructions for non-bundled setups

### Changed
- Agent-agnostic language throughout all skills ("Claude" → "the agent")

- Versioned init marker files (`.wasp-plugin-initialized-v{VERSION}`) for automatic re-init on plugin upgrades

- Moved opt-out marker from `.claude/knowledge/.wasp-init-opt-out` to `.claude/wasp/.wasp-plugin-opt-out` (legacy path still supported)
- Chrome DevTools MCP is no longer bundled in the plugin manifest — users install it separately
